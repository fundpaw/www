            <br><br> <strong>Halloween Party for Furanimals</strong>
            
            <br><br> Why not raise funds for your animal shelter this holiday season by offering pet photos with Mr. & Mrs. Santa?
            
            <br><br> Recruit a volunteers to dress up as the festive icon and find a local photographer who’d be willing to donate
            their time and to participate to make the holiday special for the furanimals! 
            
            <br><br> Next, set up a simple holiday-themed “studio” at your shelter. All you need is a backdrop and
            some festive decorations like ribbons, wrapped presents, and fairy lights.

            <br><br> You can also get people to bake Santa Cookies (edible for furanimals)
            
            <br><br> and of course don't forget to make some for volunteers too! and some finger food and drinks to snack on! 
            
            <br><br>Finally, invite pet owners to come and have their pets’ pictures taken with Santa. 
            
            <br><br>Charge a few dollars for each photo and hand out doggie bags with festive treats to sweeten the deal!

            <br><br> This event means a lot to the animals who don't have pet owners. 
            Everybody needs and deserve LOVE!!! 
            Thanks to all the people who give their time and effort to make this event happen, Yall are superawesome!
