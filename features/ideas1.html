        <p><strong>RULES & REGULATIONS:</strong> 
           
            <br><br>Donate $10 to receive ONE (1) RAFFLE TICKET, or donate $50 to receive six (6) tickets.
            
            <br><br>Only one ticket donation is required to be entered in the raffle.
            
            <br><br>One (1) raffle ticket = One (1) chance to win an adoption appointment
           
            <br><br>Raffle tickets guarantee you a chance to be selected for one of the 3 adoption appointment slots.
           
            <br><br>There is no limit on the amount of tickets you may purchase, and tickets may be purchased via this link:
            
            <br><br>https://give.classy.org/RescueRaffle2022
            <br><br>You are only eligible to be a winner one time. Regardless of the number of raffle tickets youâ€™ve donated
            for, you may not win more than one appointment time slot. Winning participants may only adopt a maximum of
            one (1) puppy.

            <br><br>Raffle tickets are non-refundable.

            <br><br>To complete the adoption, the winners must pay the full adoption fee for the puppy they choose. This is in
            addition to the cost of their raffle ticket entry and any additional raffle tickets purchased.

            <br><br>The puppies each have adoption fees of $500 that includes their spay/neuter surgery fees, their vaccinations
            and preventative care, their microchip, a free bag of starter food and a free 30-day trial of pet insurance.
            Ticketing is open from Saturday, March 19, 2022 at 12pm CST until Thursday, March 24, 2022 at 12pm CST.
            Participants must provide a valid address, email address, and phone number when purchasing a raffle
            ticket(s).

            <br><br>Entrants must be 18 years of age or older to participate.
            Following the drawing, our shelter staff will contact the THREE (3) winners to schedule their appointments
            Appointments will be scheduled in the order in which they were drawn. For example, the first individual
            whose name is drawn will get the first pick of the litter, the second individual will get second choice,
            etc.

             <br><br>If you are unable to make the appointment time that you agree to, we will reschedule a new appointment
            within 24 hours of your original appointment. However, you will forfeit your place in line, and the other
            appointments after yours will take place as scheduled.

             <br><br>We will not hold specific puppies for particular appointments or for rescheduled appointments.
            In the event you are unable to make your rescheduled adoption appointment, you forfeit your adoption
            appointment altogether, and the the individual drawn as the runner up will be contacted to schedule a new
            adoption appointment.

             <br><br>If you are a raffle winner and your adoption application is denied for any reason, the cost of your raffle
            tickets will be refunded to you.

             <br><br>On Thursday, March 24, 2022 at 2pm CST, we will draw THREE (3) winners on a Facebook live video.
            Using a random number generator app, we will choose the THREE (3) winners of the THREE (3) adoption
            appointments.

             <br><br>In the event that a winner is not eligible/able to participate or opts to forfeit their scheduled adoption
            appointment, a runner up will also be chosen.
