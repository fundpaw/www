        <p><strong>YHS Dog Wash Event</strong>

            <br><br>Sample:
            <br><br>Come out and join us the week of June 19 th from 4:30pm-6:30pm for our dog wash fundraiser!
            Dogs get dirty, and sometimes your precious pup will need a professional bath to get clean. But
            with a busy schedule and an excitable pet, finding the time and space to wash your dog can be
            a challenge. 
            <br><br>While we wash you pup, sit back and relax at our human snack station OR shop our barkery for
            some treats for your pets!
            <br><br>For each dog we wash, we ask for a donation of $15
            Tips
            <br><br> Make sure all dogs are on a leash the WHOLE time so they don’t escape
            
            Add On’s
            <br><br> Have an area for animal parent’s to hangout in that’s shaded so they can relax while
            they wait
            <br><br> Have snacks and drinks for sale for animal parents to purchase or complimentary with
            their dog wash
