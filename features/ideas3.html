        <h1>Yoga with kittens</h1>
        <h5>Feb 21, 2023 </h5>

        <img class="image" src="../assets/yogaa.jpg" alt="dog" style="width:30%">

        <p><br><br>A cat arching its back, purring in delight, already resembles a yogi, or yoga master. 
            
            <br><br>So last week,the no-kill animal shelter Homeward Bound made the connection and sent six adult cats to mingle with students at
            Yoga at Connie’s, a studio in Decatur, Illinois.

            <br><br>Homeward Bound social media volunteer Jeanette Skaluba came up with event after a video of
            12-year-old cat Oreo riding on her shoulder went viral. 
            
            <br><br>“Cats rule the Internet,” she explained, and she hoped the event
            would spur adoptions. Oreo and her feline companions alternated between the studio’s sidelines and center
            stage, getting yogi belly rubs. 
            
            <br><br>Still, one cat, Breezy, found a nice warm spot on a yoga mat underneath
            Emily Cook, forcing her to hold her yoga position until Breezy moved away.

            <br><br>June is Adopt-a-Cat month, and the collaborative event raised more than $500 for Homeward Bound.
            Even
            better, one of the yogi kitties already has a new forever home!

            <br><br><br><br>“By taking the cats to a yoga class, people have the opportunity to interact with them outside the
            shelter”

            <br><br>“It gives these cats exposure and shows their personality”

            <br><br>“I think people can envision these pets in their home easier because they’re outside the shelter”
