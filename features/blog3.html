        <p>Puppies are adorable, but they also have razor sharp teeth! So how can you handle puppy biting? Here are some
            things you should know, and tips on what to do (or not do!)

            <br><br>P.S.- if you need some individual support, book a puppy training session!


            <br><br>Yes, puppies do go through a teething period. But most of your puppy's mouthing is based on a desire for
            attention (and fun!)

            <br><br>We don't recommend saying "Ouch" or yelping to limit your puppy's mouthing- all of this can increase the
            biting because your puppy is getting your attention!

            <br><br>Puppy mouthing isn't something that'll go away right away, but you can reduce most of it fairly quickly!

            <br><br>Your puppy isn't being aggressive- they want to play and get attention, and don't yet understand that humans
            don't like this kind of play. **NOTE: if your puppy is biting you in other contexts (not just
            play/attention), PLEASE reach out to us or another qualified professional!

            <br><br>OK, let's get to the big steps to stop puppy biting!


            <br><br>PREVENT

            <br><br>Many of our puppy biting episodes are predictable- they happen at the same time of day, or usually on the
            couch when you try to cuddle, or when you're trying to work on something. So one of our best strategies is
            to prevent the biting before it happens! We've all seen a toddler having a temper tantrum in the grocery
            store and thought "that kid probably missed a nap!" So think of a biting puppy as a toddler- what can we do
            to prevent the tantrum in the first place?


            <br><br>Maybe your puppy is tired and needs a nap, or needs to go for a walk before dinner. Maybe they can't handle
            couch privileges yet, or need something good to chew on around 3pm. Look for predictors of biting, and help
            give your puppy something else to do to help them calm down! This also means giving them lots of appropriate
            chewing and enrichment throughout the day. (As an Amazon Associate, Every Dog earns from qualifying

            <br><br>TEACH AN ALTERNATIVE

            <br><br>We talk a lot about "default behaviors"- things our puppies can do on their own that we really like! Great
            examples are sit, laying down, or making eye contact- these are things that are easy, calm, and we can
            reward them pretty much anytime. In fact, we recommend having some treats (or kibble!) nearby to give
            throughout the day when you notice your puppy making the choice to do one of these calm behaviors. Your
            puppy should learn "If I want attention and treats, I should try XYZ." We reward these behaviors ALL THE
            TIME until they become major habits for your pup. If you're not sure what default behaviors to try, Schedule
            a private consultation or check out our puppy classes!


            <br><br>*Note: Socialization is a HUGE part of raising a puppy. If your puppy is under 4 months, learn more about
            socialization now. We also have some awesome puppy training resources on our Resources Page, as well as
            great webinars on puppy training.


            <br><br>But what does this have to do with biting? See the next point!


            <br><br>REDIRECT

            <br><br>When it seems like your puppy might be starting to get mouthy, start redirecting to default behaviors! When
            they make the choice to lay down, big reward. If they sit quietly, lots of praise and treats! If you can
            bring them a toy and play tug with them, great! Remember, your puppy is trying to get your attention. And
            even though it can be frustrating sometimes, they're just wee little and they NEED social time! So if your
            puppy is choosing to do one of these awesome behaviors instead of chomping on you, take some time to play
            with them or do some fun training. (Need some help with training? Book a private session or check out puppy
            classes!)


            <br><br>DAMAGE CONTROL

            <br><br>Ok, so you missed puppy nap time, and your puppy is starting to nom on you. You've tried your default
            behaviors, bringing a toy, and getting your puppy engaged in a more productive way- but puppy is in full on
            Jaws mode and won't redirect. What now? Calmly remove yourself and your attention for a few seconds. If
            they're biting your arm, pull it away. If you're on the couch, stand up. If they're nipping at your heels,
            step over a baby gate or their exercise pen.


            <br><br>In these situations you're not saying anything or telling them no- you're just calmly removing yourself. We
            generally recommend doing this for just a few seconds, and are ideally looking for them to offer a calm
            behavior of some kind before we return (sit back down, come back in, etc). If your puppy is still too
            excited and goes for chewing on you again, repeat. Here we're showing puppy that biting means the fun stops
            and the world becomes boring- but if you do any of your default behaviors, treats and attention are
            everywhere!!


            <br><br>Ok, final notes:

            <br><br>Consistency is key! If you sometimes follow these instructions, but other times you wave your arms around
            and yell at your puppy to stop, they're probably going to keep playing the bitey game!

            <br><br>Remember, puppies NEED lots of attention. If they're biting frequently, there's a good chance they're not
            getting enough mental stimulation throughout the day.

            <br><br>If you're finding yourself in the damage control step a lot, don't stay stuck in that cycle! Make sure you
            go back to earlier steps and make sure they're working.

            <br><br>Stay calm! If you stick to your routine, you'll see a big decrease in the biting. But some of it may stick
            around as your puppy learns and grows, so don't panic if they still have puppy moments!

            <br><br>Again, if your puppy is biting in other contexts (like when you approach your food bowl, when you try to
            touch their paws, or anything that seems like not-play), PLEASE reach out ASAP.
